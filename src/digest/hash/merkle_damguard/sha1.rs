// SHA-1, is a secure hashing algorithm for computing a condensed representation
// of a message or a data file. When a message of any length < 2Mbits is input,
// the SHA-1 produces a 160-bit output called a message digest.

// SHA-1 is a technical revision of SHA (FIPS 180). A circular left shift operation
// has been added to the specifications in section 7, line b, page 9 of FIPS 180
// and its equivalent in section 8, line c, page 10 of FIPS 180. This revision
// improves the security provided by this standard. The SHA-1 is based on principles
// similar to those used by Professor Ronald L. Rivest of MIT when designing the
// MD4 message digest algorithm1, and is closely modelled after that algorithm.
